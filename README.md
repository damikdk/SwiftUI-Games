# TBS (WIP)


Turn-based strategy template written on pure Swift with SceneKit.

> I am rewriting this project to be **pure SwiftUI app**. Stay tuned 

### Goals
- SwiftUI interfaces
- SceneKit render and physics
- Clean Swift with 0 dependencies
- Heroes, Abilities, Field logic
- 0 (zero) projectiles. I hate projectiles
